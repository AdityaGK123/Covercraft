## Issue #1: Voice Calibration Microphone Access Failure
**Reported**: 10:38 AM - CEO feedback
**Symptoms**: 
- Voice calibration not requesting microphone permissions
- No browser prompt for mic access
- Users cannot proceed past voice calibration step

**Business Impact**: CRITICAL - Blocks entire user flow, 0% conversion rate

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Investigating voice detection initialization
2. Checking microphone permission request flow
3. Analyzing async/await patterns in voice calibration

**Enhancement Request**: 
- Add manual scale selection for music-savvy users
- Implement Western/Hindustani/Carnatic scale translations
- Add audio samples for scale demonstration
- Create beginner-friendly UI for non-musicians
