# CoverCraft Development Session Notes

## Project Overview
**CoverCraft** - AI-powered cover creation webapp for Indian amateur singers (13-35 age group) who post on social media.

### Core Value Proposition
- Turn any song into a professional cover with AI-powered backing tracks
- No instruments or professional studio required
- Optimized for Indian music styles (Bollywood, Classical, Indie)
- Mobile-first design for social media sharing

### Target Market Research
- **Pain Points**: Lack of affordable backing tracks, no instruments, technical barriers
- **Demand Validation**: Strong interest on Reddit/forums for Indian music backing tracks
- **Pricing**: Users willing to pay â‚¹10-50 per song or â‚¹99-199/month subscription
- **Market Size**: 50M+ Indian social media users who post music content

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Cost Optimization Strategy
1. **Client-side Processing**: All audio operations use Web Audio API (no server costs)
2. **Cached Sample Library**: Pre-generated instrument samples to minimize AI usage
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works offline with service worker caching
4. **Freemium Model**: 3 free tracks to validate users before premium conversion

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with Web Components (minimal overhead)
- **Audio**: Web Audio API for voice detection, recording, and mixing
- **Deployment**: Static site on Cloudflare Pages (free tier)
- **PWA**: Service worker for offline support and installability

## Development Progress (Session 2 - August 17, 2025)
